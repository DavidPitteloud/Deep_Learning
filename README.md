**Please read the README**


This repository contains initially four folders.
- data 
- report
- scripts
- presentation


Some manipulations have to be performed to be able to run the files smoothly.
 
In the **data** file please create two empty folders, **plot** and **final_plot**. In these folders, create two empty folders, **train** and **test** again. Again recreate three empty folders, labelled as follow **buy**, **sell** and **hold**. 


Be sure that after the creation of empty folders, it respects the following architecture.

- projg04/data/plot/train/buy
- projg04/data/plot/train/hold
- projg04/data/plot/train/sell
- projg04/data/plot/test/buy
- projg04/data/plot/test/hold
- projg04/data/plot/test/sell
- projg04/data/final_plot/train/buy
- projg04/data/final_plot/train/hold
- projg04/data/final_plot/train/sell
- projg04/data/final_plot/test/buy
- projg04/data/final_plot/test/hold
- projg04/data/final_plot/test/sell

If you want to run the model several times, pictures in the folder previously created will have to be deleted. So if you wish to run the file several times, please enter this command in your Powershell (only for Mac): rm data/plot/final_model/&ast;&ast;/&ast;.&ast;


Sorry for the inconvenience but GIT apparently does not let us upload **totally** empty files, which are mandatory in our case to generate images. We may have added just a little file, but we did not want to create perturbations with our data.

Moreover, our models were too large so please could you download them on the following link and place them in a folder called **results**

Sorry again for such a long procedure


P.S We did not upload the runs as we have been struggling a lot with GitHub, apparently the bandwidth is not generous in Valais.
