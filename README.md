# Deep Learning
Deep Learning, Project in collaboration with Beaudelair


**Please read the README**


This repository contains initially four folders.
- data 
- report
- scripts
- presentation


Some manipulations have to be performed to be able to run the files smoothly.
 
In the **data** file please create two empty folders, **plot** and **final_plot**. In these folders, create two empty folders, **train** and **test** again. Again recreate three empty folders, labelled as follow **buy**, **sell** and **hold**. 


Be sure that after the creation of empty folders, it respects the following architecture.

- Deep_learning/data/plot/train/buy
- Deep_learning/data/plot/train/hold
- Deep_learning/data/plot/train/sell
- Deep_learning/data/plot/test/buy
- Deep_learning/data/plot/test/hold
- Deep_learning/data/plot/test/sell
- Deep_learning/data/final_plot/train/buy
- Deep_learning/data/final_plot/train/hold
- Deep_learning/data/final_plot/train/sell
- Deep_learning/data/final_plot/test/buy
- Deep_learning/data/final_plot/test/hold
- Deep_learning/data/final_plot/test/sell

If you want to run the model several times, pictures in the folder previously created will have to be deleted. So if you wish to run the file several times, please enter this command in your Powershell (only for Mac): rm data/plot/final_model/&ast;&ast;/&ast;.&ast;
